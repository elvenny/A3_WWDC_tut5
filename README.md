# A3_WWDC_tut5
My data visualisation was created with Tableau.
The aim of my Visualisation is to represent some basic information on some of the passengers aboard the Titanic in 1912. 
The data set I used was found on Kaggle, you can download the CSV file directly from my Git Repo, or and you can access it here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file
To access my data visualisation please download the file named "A3 Data Visualisation".
