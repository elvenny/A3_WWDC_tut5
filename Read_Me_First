My data visualisation was created with Tableau.
The aim of my Visualisation is to represent some basic information on some of the passengers aboard the Titanic in 1912. 
The data set I used was found on Kaggle and you can access it here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file
To access my data visualisation please download the file named "A3 Data Visualisation".
